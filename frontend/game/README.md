------Basic Point & Click------
-------------------------------

Rough mockup of a Point & Click game using HTML5 Canvas, using the canvas element in HTML and JAvaScript for game logic. Game creates six "targets" instantiated from a Target class. User can click on each TArget to turn it green. ONe TArget (that is blue) will take the user to another "location when clicked. REferesh if you don't see the blue one. Background sprites are stretched at the moment... this is just a mockup! THis is just to show how drawing sprites and point & click code works.

-------------------------------------------------
------Requirements (for Visual Studio Code)------
-------------------------------------------------

"Live Server" Extension - Click "Go Live" to run the game in your browser.

------------------------
------How it Works------
------------------------

• index.html creates a canvas element which is where the game will be drawn. It will be of size 800x600.
• index.html runs game.js which starts the game.
• game.js runs the game, code-specific comments in that script

------Other Notes------
-----------------------

Canvas is pretty basic, but is a good way to learn basic OOP concepts. We can always use a more complex framework if we feel we need more features at some point.

-----Suggested Videos (if necessary)------
------------------------------------------

I haven't gotten a chance to watch the series below but the first 4 videos look like they would be helpful for using canvas. Drawing shapes, drawing sprites, and clicking/event listeners are very important for oOOP game design.

I am not sure if those videos cover objects/classes, so this is a quick way to learn more about them in JavaScript if you need it:
